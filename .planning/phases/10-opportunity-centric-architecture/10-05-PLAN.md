<objective>
Wire the opportunity-centric changes into the webhook worker and classification worker, update the barrel export, and clean up deprecated code.

Purpose: Plans 03-04 created the refactored modules. This plan connects them to the actual pipeline and cleans up the public API.

Output: End-to-end pipeline uses opportunity-level tracking. Barrel export reflects the new architecture.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update webhook worker and classification worker</name>
  <files>src/webhook/worker.ts, src/classification/classification-worker.ts</files>
  <action>
**In `src/webhook/worker.ts` (processJob):**

1. Pass `finmoApplicationId` to `syncChecklistToCrm`. The Finmo application UUID is at `finmoApp.application.id` (this is the UUID like `98f332e4-...` that Finmo stores in the opportunity's custom field `ezhN6WKQLzY7MvqIKSY9`).

   Current call (step 8):
   ```typescript
   const crmResult = await syncChecklistToCrm({
     ...
     finmoDealId: applicationId,
     ...
   });
   ```

   Update to also include:
   ```typescript
   finmoApplicationId: finmoApp.application.id,
   ```

   Note: `applicationId` from the job data is the same as `finmoApp.application.id` — it's the UUID used to fetch the application. So `finmoApplicationId: applicationId` should also work. But use `finmoApp.application.id` for clarity (it's the canonical source).

2. Log `trackingTarget` from the CRM result:
   ```typescript
   console.log('[worker] CRM synced', {
     applicationId,
     contactId: crmResult.contactId,
     trackingTarget: crmResult.trackingTarget,
     fieldsUpdated: crmResult.fieldsUpdated,
     errors: crmResult.errors.length,
   });
   ```

**In `src/classification/classification-worker.ts` (processClassificationJob):**

1. The `ClassificationJobData` interface (in `src/classification/types.ts`) already has `applicationId?: string`. This is the Finmo application UUID. Pass it to `updateDocTracking`:

   Current call (step j):
   ```typescript
   const trackingResult = await updateDocTracking({
     senderEmail: senderEmail ?? '',
     documentType: classification.documentType,
     driveFileId,
     source,
     receivedAt: job.data.receivedAt,
     ...(contactId ? { contactId } : {}),
   });
   ```

   Update to also include:
   ```typescript
   finmoApplicationId: applicationId ?? undefined,
   ```

   This allows the tracking sync to find the right opportunity when a document arrives for a client with multiple deals.

2. Log the tracking target:
   ```typescript
   if (trackingResult.updated) {
     console.log('[classification] CRM tracking updated:', {
       contactId: trackingResult.contactId,
       opportunityId: trackingResult.opportunityId,
       trackingTarget: trackingResult.trackingTarget,
       newStatus: trackingResult.newStatus,
       crossDealUpdates: trackingResult.crossDealUpdates,
     });
   }
   ```
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Run `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose 2>&1 | tail -10` — all tests pass.</verify>
  <done>Webhook worker passes finmoApplicationId to checklist sync. Classification worker passes finmoApplicationId to tracking sync. Both log the tracking target.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update barrel export and clean up deprecated exports</name>
  <files>src/crm/index.ts, src/crm/contacts.ts</files>
  <action>
**In `src/crm/index.ts`:**

1. Add new exports from opportunities.ts:
   ```typescript
   export {
     searchOpportunities,
     getOpportunity,
     updateOpportunityFields,
     updateOpportunityStage,
     findOpportunityByFinmoId,
     getOpportunityFieldValue,
   } from './opportunities.js';
   ```

2. Remove deprecated exports:
   - Remove `upsertOpportunity` from export (keep function in opportunities.ts but don't export from barrel)
   - Remove `moveToCollectingDocs` from export
   - Remove `moveToAllDocsReceived` from export

3. Add new type exports:
   ```typescript
   export type { CrmOpportunity, CrmOpportunityCustomField } from './types/index.js';
   export { EXISTING_OPP_FIELDS, OPP_DOC_TRACKING_FIELD_DEFS } from './types/index.js';
   ```

4. Update tracking-sync exports to include new function:
   ```typescript
   export { updateDocTracking, parseContactTrackingFields, parseOpportunityTrackingFields } from './tracking-sync.js';
   ```

5. Verify no remaining imports of deprecated functions across the codebase (use grep). If any module still imports `moveToCollectingDocs` or `moveToAllDocsReceived` from the barrel, update those imports.

**In `src/crm/contacts.ts`:**

No functional changes needed. The contact upsert function remains unchanged — it accepts customFields and writes them. The change is at the caller level (checklist-sync no longer passes doc tracking fields to contacts when an opportunity is available).

However, add a JSDoc comment to `upsertContact` noting:
```typescript
/**
 * ...existing docs...
 *
 * NOTE (Phase 10): Doc tracking fields are now stored on opportunities,
 * not contacts. Contact upsert should only receive borrower details
 * (name, email, phone) and non-doc-tracking custom fields.
 */
```
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose 2>&1 | tail -10` — all tests pass. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Run grep for any remaining references to deprecated functions outside opportunities.ts: `grep -rn "moveToCollectingDocs\|moveToAllDocsReceived\|upsertOpportunity" src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v opportunities.ts | grep -v __tests__ | grep -v PLAN` — should show zero results (or only in test mocks that need updating).</verify>
  <done>Barrel export includes new opportunity functions. Deprecated functions removed from public API. No remaining usages of deprecated functions in production code. All tests pass.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Deprecate contact-level doc tracking fields</name>
  <files>src/crm/setup/create-custom-fields.ts, src/crm/config.ts, src/crm/types/index.ts</files>
  <action>
This task completes OPP-07 by deprecating the 9 contact-level doc tracking custom fields. We do NOT delete them from the CRM (preserves historical data), but rename them so they're visually marked as deprecated in the MBP UI and remove them from code paths.

**In `src/crm/setup/create-custom-fields.ts`:**

1. Add a `--deprecate-contact-fields` CLI flag handler:
   ```typescript
   const deprecateContactFields = process.argv.includes('--deprecate-contact-fields');
   ```

2. When `--deprecate-contact-fields` is passed, instead of creating fields, run a deprecation routine:
   - Import `DOC_TRACKING_FIELD_DEFS` from `../types/index.js`
   - For each field definition in `DOC_TRACKING_FIELD_DEFS`, read its current field ID from the corresponding `GHL_FIELD_*` env var
   - For each field ID, call `PUT /locations/:locationId/customFields/:fieldId` with `{ name: "DEPRECATED - [original name]" }` to rename it
   - Log each rename: `Renamed "[name]" -> "DEPRECATED - [name]" (fieldId: [id])`
   - If a field ID env var is empty, skip it with a warning

3. Add usage comment:
   ```
   // Deprecate contact-level doc tracking fields (Phase 10):
   //   npx tsx src/crm/setup/create-custom-fields.ts --deprecate-contact-fields
   ```

4. If `--deprecate-contact-fields` is passed, run the deprecation and exit early (do NOT also create fields).

**In `src/crm/config.ts`:**

1. Remove the `fieldIds` property from the `CrmConfig` interface entirely. This is the nuclear option that ensures no code path can accidentally write to the old contact-level doc tracking fields.

   WAIT — this would break the contact-level fallback in checklist-sync.ts and tracking-sync.ts (Plans 03/04 implement fallback to contact when no opportunity found). The fallback needs `fieldIds` to write doc tracking to contacts.

   REVISED APPROACH: Keep `fieldIds` in the config interface but rename the property to `contactFieldIds_DEPRECATED` and add a JSDoc `@deprecated` tag. Update the two fallback paths in checklist-sync.ts and tracking-sync.ts to use `contactFieldIds_DEPRECATED` (this makes the deprecation explicit in the code). In `validateConfig()`, remove the validation loop for contact field IDs (don't throw if they're empty — they'll only be used in the rare fallback case).

   Actually, this is too invasive for this plan — it would require modifying files owned by Plans 03/04. SIMPLEST approach:

   - Keep `fieldIds` in config as-is (Plans 03/04 fallback paths reference it)
   - Add a `/** @deprecated Phase 10: Use opportunityFieldIds instead. Contact-level fieldIds retained only for backward-compatible fallback. */` JSDoc comment above the `fieldIds` property in the CrmConfig interface
   - In `validateConfig()`, change the `fieldIds` validation from throwing to warning (same treatment as opportunityFieldIds in Plan 10-01): iterate `fieldIds`, if any value is empty, log a warning instead of adding to the `missing` array. This allows the system to run even after the contact-level fields are renamed to DEPRECATED in the CRM (the field IDs remain valid — renaming doesn't change IDs).

**In `src/crm/types/index.ts`:**

1. Add a `@deprecated` JSDoc comment above `DOC_TRACKING_FIELD_DEFS`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * @deprecated Phase 10: Contact-level doc tracking fields are deprecated.
    * Use OPP_DOC_TRACKING_FIELD_DEFS for opportunity-scoped fields instead.
    * These definitions are retained only for the setup script's --deprecate-contact-fields flag.
    */
   export const DOC_TRACKING_FIELD_DEFS = [
   ```
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Run `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose 2>&1 | tail -10` — all tests pass. Verify the deprecation flag is recognized: `npx tsx src/crm/setup/create-custom-fields.ts --deprecate-contact-fields --dry-run 2>&1 | head -5` (if dry-run not supported, just verify tsc passes).</verify>
  <done>Setup script supports --deprecate-contact-fields flag that renames 9 contact-level fields to "DEPRECATED - [name]" via PUT API. Contact-level fieldIds in config marked @deprecated with validation downgraded to warning. DOC_TRACKING_FIELD_DEFS marked @deprecated in types. No code path accidentally writes to contact fields (opportunity path is primary, contact path is explicit fallback marked deprecated).</done>
