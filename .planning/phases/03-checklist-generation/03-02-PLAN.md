<objective>
Encode all 17 sections of DOC_CHECKLIST_RULES_V2.md as typed ChecklistRule objects.

Purpose: This is the core domain knowledge of the system — Cat's approved checklist rules translated into executable code. Every condition, exclusion, internal check, and special case must be faithfully represented. This is the largest plan in Phase 3 but the work is mechanical: read rule, write condition function, repeat.

Output: ~80-90 ChecklistRule objects across 10 rule files, covering all document types, conditions, exclusions, and internal flags.

  <name>Task 1: Create tax year utility and rule files for Sections 0-6 (Base + Income)</name>

**First**, create `src/checklist/utils/tax-years.ts`:

Export a `getTaxYears(currentDate: Date)` function that returns:
- `currentTaxYear`: If month <= 4, this is `year - 1`. After April, `year`.
- `previousTaxYear`: `currentTaxYear - 1`
- `twoYearsAgo`: `currentTaxYear - 2`
- `t4Available`: boolean — true if month > 4 (T4s are typically available after April)

This is used by rules to generate dynamic display names like "2024/2025 T4s" instead of hardcoded years.

**Then**, create rule files. Each rule file exports a `const` array of `ChecklistRule` objects.

**`src/checklist/rules/base-pack.ts`** — Section 0 (3 rules):
- `s0_photo_id`: Government-issued photo ID (front + back). PRE. scope: per_borrower. condition: always true. displayName: "Government-issued photo ID (front + back) — driver's license or passport. Note: health cards are NOT accepted (BC Health Card with photo is OK)."
- `s0_second_id`: Second form of ID. PRE. scope: per_borrower. condition: always true. displayName: "Second form of ID (passport, credit card, PR card, SIN card, birth certificate, or firearms license)"
- `s0_void_cheque`: Void cheque or direct deposit form. FULL. scope: shared. condition: always true.
- DO NOT include "Signed Credit Consent" — it was REMOVED (auto-sent by Finmo). This is CHKL-05.

**`src/checklist/rules/income-employed.ts`** — Sections 1-2 (~10 rules):

Section 1 (Salary/Hourly) — condition: `borrowerIncomes` has entry with `source === "employed"` AND `payType` in `["salaried", "hourly"]`:
- `s1_paystub`: Recent paystub within 30 days. PRE. per_borrower. displayName: "Recent pay stub (must show YTD earnings)"
- `s1_loe`: Letter of Employment. PRE. per_borrower. displayName includes: "Must include: position, start date, salary, full-time/part-time, guaranteed hours". If income has `business` field, add employer name to notes.
- `s1_t4_previous`: T4 previous year. PRE. per_borrower. Use `getTaxYears()` for display name.
- `s1_t4_current`: T4 current year. PRE. per_borrower. notes: "If not yet available, provide last pay stub of [previous year] showing year-end earnings"
- `s1_noa_previous`: NOA previous year. FULL. per_borrower. notes: "May not be needed if 2 years of T4s are provided"
- `s1_noa_current`: NOA current year. FULL. per_borrower. notes: "If NOA shows amount owing, also provide CRA Statement of Account showing taxes paid to zero"

Section 2 (Contract/Seasonal) — condition: `borrowerIncomes` has entry with `source === "employed"` AND `jobType === "contract"`:
- `s2_contract`: Employment contract. PRE. per_borrower. displayName: "Employment contract (term, rate, renewal likelihood)"
- `s2_t4s_2year`: 2 years of T4s. PRE. per_borrower. Use dynamic years.
- `s2_noas`: NOAs current + previous. FULL. per_borrower.

**`src/checklist/rules/income-self-employed.ts`** — Sections 3-6 (~15 rules):

Section 3 (General self-employed) — condition: `borrowerIncomes` has entry with `source === "self_employed"`:
- `s3_t1_current`: T1 General current year (full return). PRE. per_borrower.
- `s3_t1_previous`: T1 General previous year. PRE. per_borrower.
- `s3_noa_current`: NOA current year. PRE. per_borrower. notes: CRA Statement if amount owing.
- `s3_noa_previous`: NOA previous year. PRE. per_borrower.
- `s3_t4_salary`: T4 if paying self a salary (incorporated + salary). FULL. per_borrower. condition: self_employed AND detectable as incorporated (businessType check or selfPayType).

Section 4 (Sole Proprietor) — condition: self_employed AND NOT detectable as incorporated. Research notes: sub-type detection is ambiguous. Default: if `businessType` is null or unrecognized AND `selfPayType` is empty/null, request the broader set. Create an `isSoleProprietor` helper.
- `s4_t2125_check`: T2125 internal check. INTERNAL_CHECK. per_borrower. internalOnly: true. internalCheckNote: "Verify T1 includes T2125 (Statement of Business Activities). Do NOT request T2125 separately." This is CHKL-05.

Section 5 (Incorporated) — condition: self_employed AND detectable as incorporated. Create an `isIncorporated` helper. If detection is uncertain, include BOTH sole prop and incorporated docs (safer).
- `s5_articles`: Articles of Incorporation. PRE. per_borrower.
- `s5_t2_schedule50`: T2 Corporate Tax Return with Schedule 50 OR Central Securities Register. FULL. per_borrower. internalCheckNote: "Verify T2 includes Schedule 50 (shareholder listing)."
- `s5_financials`: 2 years accountant-prepared financial statements. FULL. per_borrower.
- `s5_business_bank`: Business bank statements 6-12 months. LENDER_CONDITION. per_borrower. notes: "Rarely requested upfront — only collect if conditioned by lender." This is CHKL-05 (Cat said don't collect upfront).

Section 6 (Stated Income / B Lender) — condition: This is NOT auto-detectable from Finmo data. Create the rules but with a condition that will NOT automatically trigger. Instead, create an `internalFlag` of type `manual_flag` saying "If B-lender / stated income program, Cat must manually add stated income docs." The rules exist but are dormant.
- `s6_business_bank`: Business bank statements 6-12 months. PRE.
- `s6_personal_bank`: Personal bank statements 3 months. PRE.
- `s6_business_reg`: Business registration. PRE.
- `s6_income_declaration`: Signed income declaration. PRE.
- Note in section: stated income from corporation also gets all Section 5 docs.

For all rule files, use the `ChecklistRule` type imported from the types barrel. Use `.js` extension in imports for NodeNext resolution.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — all rule files compile. Count exported rules: base-pack should have 3, income-employed ~9, income-self-employed ~13.</verify>
  <done>Sections 0-6 are encoded. Base pack excludes signed credit consent. Self-employed has sole prop vs incorporated detection with safe fallback. T2125 is an internal check only. Stated income rules exist but are dormant (manual flag).</done>

Also export a `manualFlagSections` list documenting which sections require Cat's manual input (maternity, probation, stated income, support, other income, bankruptcy, residency).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — all rule files compile with no errors.

Count total rules by running a quick check: `grep -c "id:" src/checklist/rules/*.ts` to ensure we have ~80-90 rules total.

Verify CHKL-05 exclusions: grep for each removed item name and confirm they do NOT exist as non-internal rules:
- No "credit_consent" rule (or only with internalOnly if present as a note)

- No "foreign_bank_letter" rule
- No "ftb_declaration" rule
- No "ftb_ownership" rule
- No "retired_noa" rule
