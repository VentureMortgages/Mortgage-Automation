# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** When a Finmo application comes in, the right documents get requested, tracked, filed, and followed up on -- with minimal human effort and zero missed items.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.1 -- Production Hardening (Phase 12: CRM Pipeline Automation)

## Current Position

Phase: 12 (CRM Pipeline Automation) -- COMPLETE (all 3 plans executed)
Plan: 3/3 complete (12-01, 12-02, 12-03)
Status: Phase complete -- ready for Phase 13
Last activity: 2026-02-26 -- 12-02 (sent-detector refactor for opportunity-level stage move + task auto-complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0):**
- Total plans completed: 31
- Average duration: 4 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Reminders: CRM task + email to Cat (not auto-send to client) -- Cat copy/pastes from task
- Multi-borrower folders: "Last/Last, First/First" format matching Cat's Drive convention
- extractDriveFolderId normalizes both raw IDs and full Drive URLs to folder IDs
- All CRM persistence operations wrapped in non-fatal try/catch (failures must not block pipeline)
- Task dedup uses title pattern matching ("Review doc request") on contact tasks
- createOrUpdateReviewTask is public API; createReviewTask remains for internal use
- Professional contact type stored as GHL tag (additive merge), not custom field -- simplest for filtering
- assignContactType is non-fatal: catches all errors internally, Cat can tag manually
- Sent-detector stage move uses searchOpportunities (first result) not findOpportunityByFinmoId (lacks finmoApplicationId context)
- Review task auto-complete happens inline in sent-detector flow (step 3b), colocated with stage move

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SPF/DKIM/DMARC not configured on venturemortgages.com -- emails may go to spam (Taylor action item)
- Google Sheets API scope missing from domain-wide delegation -- budget sheet broken
