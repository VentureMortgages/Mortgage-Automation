## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Reminders: CRM task + email to Cat (not auto-send to client) -- Cat copy/pastes from task
- Multi-borrower folders: "Last/Last, First/First" format matching Cat's Drive convention
- extractDriveFolderId normalizes both raw IDs and full Drive URLs to folder IDs
- All CRM persistence operations wrapped in non-fatal try/catch (failures must not block pipeline)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SPF/DKIM/DMARC not configured on venturemortgages.com -- emails may go to spam (Taylor action item)
- Google Sheets API scope missing from domain-wide delegation -- budget sheet broken
