# Document Checklist Rules V2 — Cat-Reviewed

**Status:** APPROVED (with Cat's corrections applied)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-09
**Source:** Cat's annotated PDF review of V1

## PRE vs FULL Classification

- **PRE** = Required for pre-approval (must collect early)
- **FULL** = Required for full file / lender submission
- **REMOVED** = Cat removed from checklist (not requested by them)
- **LENDER CONDITION** = Only collected if lender specifically conditions it

> **Design Decision:** Initial email requests ALL docs (PRE + FULL). PRE/FULL tags are used internally to:
> 1. Track when enough docs are in for pre-approval (all PRE satisfied)
> 2. Prioritize follow-up reminders (PRE docs first)
> 3. Notify Taylor when pre-approval-ready
