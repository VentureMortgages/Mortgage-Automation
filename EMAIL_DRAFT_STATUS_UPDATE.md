Subject: Automation Update — Here's Where We're At

---

Hey Taylor & Cat,

Wanted to give you both a quick update on where the automation system stands and what we need from each of you to get it running in your day-to-day.

What's been built:

- Automatic doc checklists — When a new Finmo app comes in, the system generates a personalized list of required docs based on the borrower's situation (employment type, co-borrowers, down payment, etc.)
- Draft emails to clients — A professional doc-request email is generated as a draft for Cat to review before sending. Nothing goes out without Cat's approval.
- CRM tracking — MyBrokerPro automatically gets updated with the full checklist, tracking which docs are received vs. missing as they come in
- Document classification & filing — When you forward client emails to docs@, the system identifies the document type using AI, renames it using Cat's naming convention, and files it to the right subfolder in Drive
- Returning client detection — For clients who already have docs on file from a previous application, the system scans their folder, identifies what's still valid, and removes those from the email request. Clients don't get asked for things we already have.
- Budget sheet automation — A copy of the master budget template gets created in the client's Drive folder with the right tab selected and purchase price, down payment, FTHB status, location, and defaults pre-filled

What we need from Cat:

I sent 11 draft doc-request emails to admin@venturemortgages.com on Feb 16 — these were generated from real Finmo applications. Cat, when you get a chance, could you look through a few of them and let us know:
- Do the doc requests look right for each client's situation?
- Is the wording clear?
- Anything missing or anything that shouldn't be there?

This is the main thing holding us up before we can turn it on for new applications.

What we need from Taylor:

I can create a test budget sheet from any of your current Finmo apps so you can check the cell positions and defaults are right. Just let me know and I'll send you a link to review.

What happens next:

1. Incorporate Cat's email feedback
2. Taylor reviews a test budget sheet
3. Run a full end-to-end test with a live Finmo application (including the doc forwarding → classification → filing pipeline)
4. Quick 30-min walkthrough with Cat on the new workflow
5. Monitor the first couple weeks and tune as needed

There's still a few things on the roadmap — automated follow-up reminders for missing docs, custom GPTs for Taylor, email automation, and a few edge cases to handle as they come up in real usage.

The system has a kill switch — if anything goes sideways, we flip one switch and everything stops. Manual process continues as before. And every email is a draft that Cat reviews before it goes out, so there's no risk of something going to a client without a human check.

Let me know if you have any questions or want to hop on a quick call to walk through it.

Luca
