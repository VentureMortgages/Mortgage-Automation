**Meeting:** MyBrokerPro onboarding with Taylor
**Role:** Fly on the wall / observer
**Goal:** Understand CRM capabilities for automation planning

---

## Priority Questions (Ask if opportunity arises)

### API & Integrations

1. **Does MyBrokerPro/GoHighLevel have API access?**
   - Can we query contacts by email?
   - Can we update custom fields via API?
   - Is there webhook support (trigger external systems on events)?

2. **What integrations are available out of the box?**
   - Google Drive?
   - Gmail?
   - Zapier / Make / n8n?

3. **Are there any API rate limits or restrictions?**

### Contacts & Custom Fields

4. **Can we add custom fields to contact records?**
   - Needed: Secondary emails, Drive folder URL, application type, employment type

5. **Can contacts have multiple email addresses?**
   - Critical for matching spouse/alternate emails

6. **Is there a way to search/query contacts by email via the UI or API?**

### Pipelines & Stages

7. **What pipeline stages are being set up?**
   - Ideally maps to: Lead → App Submitted → Doc Collection → Budget Call → House Hunting → Live Deal → Funded

8. **Can pipeline stage changes trigger automations?**

### Workflows & Automations

9. **What built-in workflow/automation capabilities exist?**
   - Auto-email on stage change?
   - Reminder sequences?
   - SMS notifications?

10. **Can workflows be triggered by external events (webhooks)?**
    - e.g., "Doc received" triggers checklist update

11. **Is there a task/checklist feature per contact?**
    - Could this replace the Google Docs tracking lists?

### Permissions & Access

12. **Can we get a dev/API user account?**
    - Separate from Taylor and Cat's accounts

13. **What permission levels are available?**
    - Admin vs user vs API-only?
